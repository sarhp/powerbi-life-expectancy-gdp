**<summary>Relationship between GDP Per Cap and Life Expectancy</summary>**

ðŸ”¸ Positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy indicates countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy.

ðŸ”¸ However, there is a point where improvements in life expectancy remains plateau even GDP continues to increase - this could be due to a higher GDP can improve living conditions like healthcare, but doesnâ€™t necessarily guarantee continued gains in life expectancy beyond a certain level.

**<summary>Income</summary>**

ðŸ”¸ Europe has the most high-level income earners (note that thereâ€™s no data for â€˜lowâ€™ income).
